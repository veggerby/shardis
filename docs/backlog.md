| Ring hashers (`IShardRingHasher`, default + FNV-1a) | ‚úÖ Done | `core` | Abstraction + implementations for ring node hashing. |
| Streamed querying primitives (`ShardBroadcaster`, `ShardStreamBroadcaster`) | ‚úÖ Done | `core` | Parallel shard dispatch + streaming aggregation. |
| Ordered merge enumerator (`ShardisAsyncOrderedEnumerator`) | ‚úÖ Done | `core` | K-way streaming merge for global ordering. |
| Combined enumerator | ‚úÖ Done | `core` | Non-ordered interleaving enumerator. |
| `IShardKeyHasher<TKey>` pluggable hashing | ‚úÖ Done | `core` | Deterministic key hashing abstraction. |
| Metrics interface (`IShardisMetrics`) + counter impl | ‚úÖ Done | `infra` | Hookable routing metrics (hits, misses, new/existing). |
| DI options surface (`AddShardis` + options) | ‚úÖ Done | `dx` | Configurable router strategy, hashers, replication factor, stores. |
| Benchmarks project | ‚úÖ Done | `infra` | Baseline performance harness (routers, hashers). |
| Migration scaffolding (`IShardMigrator`, plan/execute) | ‚úÖ Done | `core` | Foundation for future safe key moves. |
| Documentation overhaul (README, index, migration, metrics) | ‚úÖ Done | `dx` | Core concepts + roadmap captured. |
| Assertion unification (AwesomeAssertions) | ‚úÖ Done | `dx` | Standardized on external AwesomeAssertions package. |
| Fluent query prototype (`ShardQuery` internal) | üß™ Prototype | `dx` | Early LINQ-style API (ordering & provider integration pending). |
| Metrics duplication elimination (consistent router) | ‚úÖ Done | `core` | Single metrics emission via unified Resolve helper. |
| Consistent ring binary search lookup | ‚úÖ Done | `perf` | Snapshot key array + Array.BinarySearch replaces linear scan. |
| Shared routing resolve helper (both routers) | ‚úÖ Done | `core` | Centralizes assignment + metrics logic (removes duplication). |
| Map store CAS primitive (`TryAssignShardToKey`) | ‚úÖ Done | `core` | Atomic first-writer wins; routers avoid overwrite races. |
| Shard ID uniqueness validation | ‚úÖ Done | `core` | Duplicate shard IDs detected early in router constructors. |
| Broadcaster completion & cancellation hardening | ‚úÖ Done | `core` | Deterministic channel completion + early cancellation support. |
| Removed per-item Task.Yield in enumeration | ‚úÖ Done | `perf` | Eliminated unnecessary scheduling overhead in query prototype. |
| Early cancellation for Any / First | ‚úÖ Done | `perf` | Linked CTS cancels remaining producers after first match. |
